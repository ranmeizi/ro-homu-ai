# APIs/Enums  

RO client provides us with a few APIs to allow scripts to control homucluse, this section will introduce all of these apis.

If you want see FFI, look this [ragnarok.lua](../../USER_AI/libs/ragnarok.lua) (not completely accurate but helps to understand)

## APIs

### TraceAI

Call ```TraceAI``` to write log message in TraceAI.txt. The premise is that you need to enter the command ```/traceai``` in the client chatbox.

for example:

```lua
function AI(id) 
    TraceAI('show tick' .. GetTick())
end
```

And open your ro client folder, find 'TraceAI.txt',open and you will see many line will be loged in this file. and this API is the most commonly used debugging method

### MoveToOwner

Command homu to move to owner.

for example:

```lua
    -- When your homu is some distance away from you
    MoveToOwner(id)
```

can be eq to Move -> owner's position

### Move  

Command homu to move to coordinate  

for example:

```lua
function AI(id) 
    local x,y = GetV(V_POSITION,id)
    Move(id,x+1,y)
end
```

Then your homu will keep moving right one square at a time.

### Attack

Command homu to attack this enemy_id's object.

### GetV

Get some type of veriable from client.

### GetActors

Get a id table list of object in map(or screen?)

for example:

iter all objects and find enemy

```lua
function AI(id) 
    local actors = GetActors()
    
    for index, value in ipairs(actors) do
        if IsMonster(value) == 1
            TraceAI('find enemy, id = ' .. value)
        end
    end
end
```
